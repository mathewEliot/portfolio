This is my portfolio. It exists to showcase my ability to work with python.
I apologize if you have any difficulty setting up any of my programs, though don't blame it on the incompetence of a Junior programmer, blame it on the difficulties of setting up projects that use APIs and sockets.
If you aren't looking for a headache, File Sorter is definitely the most easy to set up program in my portfolio.
